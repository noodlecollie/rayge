I've been doing some investigation into Zig and its interactions with C, and at the moment I don't think it's right for this project. There are a number of very nice features (exhaustive switches and deferred statements come to mind immediately), but the language and ecosystem are not as mature as I'd like, and I don't really like the build system either. In order to build C projects you either have to rewrite the build scripts in Zig, or invoke CMake/Make in a roundabout way, and neither is a particularly appealing option. It might be a cool language to use for a ground-up project that has the time to dedicate to learning it and figuring out its foibles, but I don't think that's what I'm trying to do here.
